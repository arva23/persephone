# Persephone
It is a heat conduction simulation program that provides finite volumetric heat conduction simulation by finite time step and equidistant spatial grid model.
The software architecture is represented as a distributed system, that can be utilized and executed on computing grid infrastructure. The system owns the 
general properties of a distributed software.
